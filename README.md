# Peer-graded Assignment: Course Project 1
## Coursera Specialization Ana Carmen Estrada Real

In this repository you are going to find:

 1. The **plot*.R** which contains the code for creating each plot.
 2. The **plot*.png** files produced and exported by my R code.
 
 The plot*.R file will automatically download the data from the web. So, to recreate the plots you just have to run the code each time, if you don't want to download four times you can comment the download.file() function on the rest of the files.
